# SpaceShips
A space-themed infinite runner for Android  

Current development level: Alpha

Android files can be found in the android folder. The java folder contains graphics and sources for the earlier Java version of this game.

Vector (.svg) graphics are used for launcher icons as well as layout components (buttons, logos, etc.). These should be stored in android/res/drawable. 

Other graphics (sprites and animations) should start in vector format and be placed in the vector-graphics folder. The android/res folder contains folders for drawables for different screen densities (-hdpi, -ldpi, -mdpi, -xhdpi) and the vector graphics should be scaled and placed in appropriate folders (see [Provide Alternative Bitmaps](http://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities.html#TaskProvideAltBmp) in the Android Documentation).
